# Fantastic Bits Game Project

This project is a simulation-based game inspired by Quidditch, where players control wizards to catch snaffles and score points. It's built with Java, emphasizing object-oriented programming, simulations, and strategic AI development.

## What I Learned

Throughout the development of the Fantastic Bits game, I've gained a wealth of knowledge and skills, including but not limited to:

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Encapsulation**: Organizing the game into classes with private fields and public methods to safely manage the game state.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Using abstract classes and interfaces for game entities to promote code reuse and flexibility.

### Algorithms and Mathematics
- **Pathfinding**: Implementing algorithms to navigate wizards effectively around the playing field.
- **Simulation**: Simulating game dynamics to predict the outcomes of various actions, which is crucial for AI decision-making.
- **Geometry and Trigonometry**: Calculating angles, distances, and velocities to handle movements and collisions accurately.

### AI and Strategy
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Designing an AI that manages multiple agents (wizards) with coherent strategies that adapt based on the game state.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Anticipating opponents' moves and the future positions of objects to make informed decisions.
- **Decision Trees**: Evaluating multiple possible actions each turn to select the optimal strategy.
